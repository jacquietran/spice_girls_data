The data this week comes from [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) and [Genius](https://www.genius.com). Thank you to the authors of the `spotifyr` and `geniusr` packages for making it easy to access data from these platforms!

There are 3 data sets about or related to the Spice Girls:

- `studio_album_tracks`: Audio features of each song from the three studio albums by the Spice Girls. From Spotify.
- `related artists`:  Artists deemed to be similar to the Spice Girls, with info about each artist including their musical genres and follower numbers. Includes a row with details for the Spice Girls, for comparison purposes. From Spotify.
- `lyrics`: Lyrics of each song from the three studio albums by the Spice Girls. From Genius.

## Data dictionaries

A data dictionary for each data set is provided [here](https://github.com/jacquietran/spice_girls_data/blob/main/data_dictionaries.md).

## Example use

The code below uses the `studio_album_tracks` data set to produce summary statistics for selected audio features.

```{r, message = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(dplyr)

# Read data into R
studio_album_tracks <- readr::read_csv("https://github.com/jacquietran/spice_girls_data/raw/main/data/studio_album_tracks.csv")

# For each album, calculate mean values for danceability, energy, and valence
studio_album_tracks %>%
  group_by(album_name) %>%
  summarise(
    danceability_mean = mean(danceability),
    energy_mean = mean(energy),
    valence_mean = mean(valence)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  # Set factor levels of album_name
  mutate(
    album_name = factor(
      album_name, levels = c("Spice", "Spiceworld", "Forever"))) %>%
  arrange(album_name)

```
